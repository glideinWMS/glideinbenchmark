The GlideinBenchmark development been sponsored
by Fermi Research Alliance, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC02-07CH11359 with the
U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of High Energy Physics.

GlideinBenchmark heavily relies on [GlideinWMS](https://glideinwms.fnal.gov/), which in turn relies on
[HTCSS](https://htcondor.org/).
The support of the GlideinWMS and HTCSS teams is invaluable in the realization of GlideinBenchmark.
